### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm curently working on project implementation and software develop.
I'm curently learning Paas and algorithm design.
Ask mee about this project and working experience, I have so many story.
I am often in a trance, like to look at some useless things.
But I still love a verb, that's the only thing that I always respect.
Get to know me, not the chance you have.
